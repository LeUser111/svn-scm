Working:

    rename file (under version control) to file
    move file (under version control) into folder (under version control)
    rename folder (under version control) to folder

    move multiple files (under version control) into folder (under version control)
    move folder with children (under version control) into folder (under version control)
    move multiple folders with children (under version control) into folder (under version control)

    refactor/rename class (under version control) in Java
    refactor/move class (under version control) in Java
    refactor/rename package (under version control) in Java

    file to file <- nothing to do, source not under version control
    folder to folder <- nothing to do, source not under version control
    file (under version control) to file (under version control)
    file (under version control) to file (ignored)

    move file(s) (under version control) into (nested) folder (not under version control) <-- folder is added without its other content
    move folder(s) (under version control) into (nested) folder (not under version control) <-- folder is added without its other content

    move file(s)/folder(s) into ignored folder or subfolder of ignored folder <-- sends deletion prompt, can be configured to auto-remove


NOT Working yet:

    move with mixed revision (how does that even happen?)

    move to something that is deleted (should remove deletion?)


TODO:

    commits across multiple projects (e.g. in diff explorer)
